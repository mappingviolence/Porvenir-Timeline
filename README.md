## About

Mapping Violence recovers lost and obscured cases of racial violence in Texas from 1900 to 1930, a period of now largely forgotten bloodshed. Making these histories public is a crucial step towards reckoning with the long legacies of violence.

This timeline documents actions by survivors (left) and the state (right) following the Porvenir Massacre. This timeline includes photographs, maps, documents, and visualizations to help discuss the erasure and commemoration of the Porvenir Massacre over the last century, culminating in the 100th anniversary in 2018.

This timeline is adapted from chapter 3, "Denial of Justice", in Monica Muñoz Martinez's book, [*The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence*](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976436&content=bios), published by Harvard University Press in September 2018.
