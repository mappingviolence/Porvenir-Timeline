          <h2>Legal Processions</h2>
          <p>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, many ethnic Mexicans throughout the borderlands took on the arduous task of pleading for common justice. In some cases, there were long and laborious legal procedures. The survivors of the Porvenir massacre turned to diplomatic procedures and filed claims through the US-Mexico General Claims Commission, which allowed surviving relatives to charge the US government with liability in the death of their relatives. When victims were Mexican nationals, their survivors could appeal to Mexican consuls and challenge violence at the hands of Texas law enforcement and US soldiers. These procedures required the support of neighbors, lawyers, and diplomats. </p>

					<h2>Mexican Attorneys Respond</h2>
					<h3>July 5, 1935</h3>
					<p>Mexican attorneys respond to the U.S. attorneys' answer, submitting a fifty-page brief with the commission for the survivors of the Porvenir massacre. The brief argues that the United States was intentionally responsible for the death of fifteen Mexican citizens murdered by the Texas Rangers in Company B because it did not properly apprehend and punish the U.S. citizens who had murdered the Mexican nationals.</p>

					<h3>September 13, 1935</h3>
					<p>Bert L. Hunt, a U.S. attorney, responds to the Mexican claims by filing an incendiary reply brief. The reply brief disputes the claim that victims of the massacre were honest and honorable men, justifying the Porvenir massacre as an example of violence by authorities to quell violence at the hands of the Mexican bandits in the region.</p>

            <h2>Commemoration</h2>
            <p>The survivors of the Porvenir massacre were denied legal, financial, and symbolic forms of redress. Unsettled by the injustices they witnessed, a few Porvenir residents built their own archives and wrote their own histories of the massacre. It offered them the chance to find some form of consolation. It also preserved the possibility that there might be justice in the future. To reckon with the tragedy of the Porvenir massacre, residents turned to mourning, remembering, and retelling the story of that tragedy. In turn, their reckoning became a political act of resistance. </p>
